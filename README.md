## Dependencies

Since the programme is written in rust, it's necessary to set up the rust toolchain. It can easily be done with a single command:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

To create the histogram plot for the numbers it's necesarry to set up `conda` and install the `matplotlib` library.
